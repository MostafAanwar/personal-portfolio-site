        <h3>About this project</h3>
        <p>
          This is a prototype website was made part of crisis Hackx MENA
          hackathon to help against Covid-19. In the current days we are living
          in corona-virus known as COVID-19 has made us change our daily routine
          drastically which caused a lot of changes whether do we work from home
          or we have to go down and work from the office and a lot of other
          aspects of our lives has changed. Most of the countries are under
          complete or partial lock-down or a curfew, for example in Egypt the
          lock-down starts from the night so people are only allowed to go in
          the morning mostly for essential needs such as getting food supplies
          or medicines. The main problem here is if people are not cautious
          enough when going around (if not keeping social distance and other
          precautions) so in our efforts to try and minimize that and reduce
          people gatherings as much as possible in order to reduce the spread of
          the virus we made a website that would help people to search in
          categories ( supermarkets, pharmacies ...etc ) in the areas around
          them depending on the crowdedness of the place from the intended
          category. In addition to that, you can also search by how far/close is
          a needed place in order for us to help you go to a less crowded shop
          or reschedule your shopping.
